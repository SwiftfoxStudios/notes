> PCA is used for dimension reduction based on the analysis of correlations amongst attributes in a dataset, using the [[Covariance|covariance]] of the dataset.

In essence, we have a series of iterations, where each iteration fits an ellipsoid to a principal component, to reduce the dimensionality by selecting two axes such that the covariance between an axis and an another axis are minimised.
