Images are acquired and stored according to the principles of *Image Acquisition*. A camera has three components which assist with this:

- [[Colour Filter Array]]
- [[Imaging Sensor]]
- [[Gamma Correction]]

Once the image has been acquired, it is [[Image Representation|represented]] using an array of pixel data. This can then be [[Image Compression|compressed]].
