> There are a range of methods for the quantitative analysis of the differences between images, especially when invisible to a visual comparison.

These include [[Mean Squared Error|MSE]] and the [[Pearson Correlation Coefficient]] (using [[Covariance]]).

As such, MSE is a simple measure of *dissimilarity*, with the PCC being a more complex measure of *similarity*, with the image being treated as a random variable.

Alternatively, we may choose to use [[Structural Similarity|structural similarity (SSIM)]] to determine image similarity.
