> Multiplexing is the process of transmitting multiple data sources over a shared medium.

There are commonly four types in usage:

- Space Division Multiplexing (SDM)
This is when users are divided spatially, for example, radio stations in different cities.

- Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
Users are granted the entire bandwidth for some given time $t$, such that they are separated temporally.

- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
Users operate over distinct frequencies, much as how [[Modulation|FM]] radio works.

- Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)
This is when distinct transmissions occur simultaneously by encoding the signals in different ways.
