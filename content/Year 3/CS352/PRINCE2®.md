> **PRojects IN Controlled Environments** is a project management methodology with a focus on deliverables.

## 7 Principles
The principles of PRINCE2 are the underlying beliefs of the methodology.

1. **Continuous Business Justification** - is there still a feasible business case for continuing?
2. **Learn From Experience**
3. **Defined Roles & Responsibilities** - specifically, who is held accountable?
4. **Manage By Stages** - manageable chunks, **NOT** waterfall.
5. **Manage By Exception** - let them get on with it!
6. **Focus On Products**
7. **Tailor To The Environment** - the size, importance and complexity too.

## 7 Processes
> The seven processes model the roadmap of a project.

1. **Starting a Project**
2. **Initiating a Project**
3. **Managing Stage Boundaries**
4. **Controlling a Stage** (Repeated)
5. **Managing Product Delivery** (Repeated)
6. **Project Closure**

Generally, the last process feeds into all the others: **Directing the Project**.

## 7 Themes
> These overlap slightly with the principles. They are general knowledge areas of the methodology.

1. **Business Case**
2. **Organisation**
3. **Quality**
4. **Plans**
5. **Risk**
6. **Change**
7. **Progress**
## Issues
Generally, many people consider this methodology to be too bureaucratic - there is too much paperwork to justify the project. It is generally product-orientated too, which may not be suited to the task at hand; this is changeable, though.
