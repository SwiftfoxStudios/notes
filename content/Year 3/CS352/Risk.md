> ISO 31000 defines risk as *the effect of uncertainty on objectives*.

Below are some methods to mitigate risk.

## Risk Identification
### RACI
> The **Responsibility Assignment Matrix** has the aim of ensuring accountability.

It should record who is:
- **R**esponsible (at least one person, too many causes a **turf war**)
- **A**ccountable (this should only be one person)
- **C**onsulted (too many people slows it down)
- **I**nformed (who to keep in the loop)

### SWOT analysis
> This is a matrix tool used to analyse internal and external factors affecting risk.

Other risk identification methods exist, such as the **Risk Breakdown Structure**.
## Identifying Causes
### Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram
This diagram separates types of risks into groups (commonly the 4 P's) and identifies the particular causes that may generate said risks.

### Sensitivity Analysis
> Loosely, sensitivity analysis is a tool to analyse how much dependent factors are affected by changes in the value of (typically, the variance of) related independent variables.

A deterministic method of conducting SA is by using a *tornado diagram*. This shows how the numerical range of each factor affects the end net value.

## Responding to Risks
### Risk Management Plan
> This is a plan on handling risk; it describes the outcome in the event of the risk occurring - the *risk response*.

Generally, the aim is to categorise the risk into:
- Avoid (plan so it never happens)
- Control (reduce probability)
- Accept (respond quickly)
- Transfer (insure it)
### Risk Matrix
> A risk matrix allows us to categorise risks according to impact (severity) and probability.

### FMEA
> **Failure Modes & Effects Analysis** is a method of finding what is likely to go wrong, and the intensity of the effect of it occurring.

Essentially, the *severity, difficulty to detect & probability of occurrence* are calculated, on a scale of 1-10.
Then, $$CRIT = SEV \cdot OCC$$
$$RPN = CRIT \cdot DET$$
Such that the **Risk Priority Number, RPN**, is the priority level of the risk. A larger number is a larger threat to the project.
