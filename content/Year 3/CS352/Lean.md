> Lean thinking is about reducing waste. It defines three types of waste:
> **Muri** (Overburden, e.g. unreasonable quantities of production)
> **Muda** (Wastefulness, e.g. defects in production)
> **Mura** (Unevenness, e.g. uneven flow in production)

Essentially, this means we have seven principles (Toyota, 2001) that embody lean, aiming to reduce waste and increase production efficiency:
- Eliminate waste (Muda)
- Amplify learning (MVP)
- Lower inventory with JIT ([[Kanban]], Muri)
- Deliver fast by maximising flow ([[Kanban]])
- Utilise skills (MVP)
- Build product integrity (Muda)
- See the whole process (Mura, Muri)

Lean is characterised by a pull-based system (acting on demand) - "*we build what we need when it is needed*". This is **Kanban**, characterised by *just-in-time* (JIT) manufacturing.

We also use the **Minimum Viable Product** (MVP) to embody lean. This ensures customer demand is at the heart of the manufacturing process.

These principles go hand in hand with the **five pillars** of lean:
- Identify value
- Map the value stream (life cycle of a product; eliminate muda)
- Create flow
- Establish pull (JIT)
- Seek perfection (continuous improvement)

## Toyota's Principles
> *Toyota*, the creator of lean, created a *lean house* to represent their lean processes. The aim is **high quality, low cost, shortest lead time**

It does this with two major pillars: *JIT* and *Jidoka* (Intelligent Automation)

> *Jidoka* is the principle that faults **stop** a workflow and a countermeasure is put in place

Supporting these pillars is three key principles:
- Heijunka - level production to reduce waste
- Standardised Work
- Continuous Improvement
