> **Agile is not Waterfall and Waterfall is not Agile**
## Waterfall
**Waterfall** is a simple, logical method of production, where a section of development is completed only after its dependencies. Essentially, it is characterised by a flow of tasks:
$$Initiation \to Design \to Construction \to Testing \to Deployment$$
In reality, this is almost always not the tool for the job, as it doesn't really support parallelism nor large uncertainty in specification/requirements.

## Agile
**Agile** is characterised by major user/customer involvement through iterations. It is a value-driven approach, where task priority is established by **value to the customer**. Agile produces the features that are *needed*, not *wanted*.

### Scrum
The majority of agile projects are undertaken using the Scrum methodology. It has several artefacts to aid production.

Firstly, there are three main team member titles:
- **Scrum Master** - not a leader, a servant and communicator.
- **Product Owner** - the customer representative
- **Development Team**

Then, development is characterised by:
- **Product Backlog** - a document consisting of all features desired by the PO.
- **Sprint Backlog** - identifies tasks that are viable within the sprint window.
- **Daily Scrum** - a very brief meeting to discuss progress within the sprint.
- **Increment** - standalone delivery of a part of the product, delivered to the customer.
