> Kanban is a [[Lean|lean method]] which is characterised by WIP (Work-In-Progress) development.

The idea is that team members are forced to work on a limited number of tasks, reducing overburden and task switching. It also uses the [[Lean]] principle of being **pull**-orientated.

The properties of effective Kanban:
- Visualise Workflow
- Limit **WIP**
- Manage **Flow**
- Make Process Policies Explicit
- Improve Collaboratively

Fundamentally, the focus is on continuous delivery. This is done by ensuring keeping to a pull, WIP system with flow management.

> IDLE TIME = BOTTLENECK
> PRESSURE = NOT A PULL SYSTEM
