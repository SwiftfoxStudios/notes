> The Fourier series splits any periodic waveform into constituent sine waves with varying frequency. That is, any periodic waveform is a sum of sinusoids.

Using [[Euler's Formula]], we have a function $f(t)$ with period $T$:
$$
\Huge s_N(t) = \sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}c_n\cdot e^{\frac{2i\pi nx}{T}}
$$

The example above shows a periodic wave and its constituent waveforms.
An extension of this can apply to non-periodic functions, the [[Fourier Transform]].
