> Exteroceptive sensors measure a quantity of the external environment.

## Inclinometers
> Inclinometers measure the rotation about the global pitch axis. That is, it measures an object's relative tilt.

In practice, there are two types: **mercury switches (discrete)** and **electrolyte sensors (continuous)**.

## Inertial Measurement Unit
> IMUs use the principle of *[[Dead Reckoning|dead reckoning]]* to determine position and orientation using measurement systems such as accelerometers and gyroscopes and some initial quantities.

For many long-distance, precise and outdoor systems, this has been mainly replaced by GPS. For many indoor or low power, low accuracy scenarios, it can be a simple, useful method of estimation.

Likewise, if a position cannot be continually tracked (such as a hostile moving vehicle), it can be a good estimation source.

## Light & Temperature Sensors
> Typically implemented with photoresistors and thermistors to generate a voltage dependent on incident light or temperature, respectively.

## Touch Sensors
> **Contact sensors** rely on a *bumper* or *lever* to detect contact, resulting in a binary classifier.
> **Tactile sensors** use *piezoelectricity*, such that an electrical signal is generated due to pressure.

## PIR Sensors
> A common IR sensor (PIR) uses a passing body's warmth to generate a signal differential, resulting in a detection.

On the contrary, *active* IR sensors emit an IR wave in order to determine [[Vision & Range Sensing|range]].
