> Observational errors are the deviation from the truth in a measured quantity.
## Systematic
> Systematic errors are predictable and can be modelled. These can be due to imperfect calibration or drift. 
## Random
> Random errors can be treated probabilistically, usually via a stochastic method.

In many cases, both types of error can be observed and can be blurred together, for example due to *specular reflection*.
