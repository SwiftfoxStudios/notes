> The **Configuration Space**, or **C-Space**, of a system represents the set of possible configurations of objects operating in that system.

In simplest terms, a particle moving in a 3D Euclidian space, $S$, has $C(S) = \mathbb{R}^3$.

## In Motion Planning
In [[Path Planning|motion planning]], we can transform a workspace into the C-Space, by representing the following:

- [[Robot]] pose as configurations in the space.
- Obstacles as occupied configurations.
- All other space as free configurations.
