> A robot is an artificial device that can sense the environment and act purposefully in it, autonomously.

We define a robot having some environment based **inputs** (sensors) and **outputs** (signals and locomotion)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Increased Productivity | Limited by programming |
| Accuracy & Precision | Lack of Dexterity |
| Ability to work in hostile environments | Robot Vision Limitations|
## Intelligence
> Autonomy != Intelligence. We can improve a robot's *intelligence* by:

- Pre-programming a larger number of behaviours (in complex environments, however, we cannot be exhaustive!)
- Explicitly represent the uncertainty in the environment
- Design the robot to learn from experience
## Mobility
> A mobile robot has the ability to move in its environment.

As such, it asks the questions:
- Where am I ([[Sensing]])
- Where am I going (Localisation & Mapping)
- How do I get there (Planning & Control)
