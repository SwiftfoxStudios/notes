> These are sensors that measure an internal quantity about a robot acting in an environment.

## Wheel Encoders
> Wheel encoders convert angular position into an output signal via light gates. They are often also called *rotary encoders*.

## Gyroscopes
> Gyroscopes measure (and have the ability to fix) orientation in relation to an external reference frame.

Mechanical gyroscopes work by having a fast spinning rotor, which tends to resist changes in angular velocity.

Optical gyroscopes use laser beams.
## Accelerometer
> Accelerometers use the principle of the resistance to motion that a dampened spring holding a mass has. As such, it can measure acceleration along a single axis.

Three accelerometers placed orthogonally can capture three axes of acceleration.
One type of accelerometer is the MEMS Accelerometer, which uses fixed electrodes and a fixed shell, with a moving mass. The resultant acceleration causes a completed circuit.
