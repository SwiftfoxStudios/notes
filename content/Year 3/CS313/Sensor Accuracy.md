> Accuracy is defined as the degree of conformity between the observation and the ground truth.

In the real world, it of course is a problem that *we don't know what the truth is unless we observe it*.

The difference between the observation and truth is the *[[Error|error]]*. As such:
$$ accuracy = 1 - \frac{error}{truth} $$
