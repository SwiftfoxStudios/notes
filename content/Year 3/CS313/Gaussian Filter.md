> These use a Gaussian distribution to determine a probability distribution about an event at a given time.

Within linear spaces, the [[Kalman Filter]] can be used.
However, in nonlinear spaces, the Kalman Filter tends to not make accurate predictions. Instead, better estimators are the [[Extended Kalman Filter]] and [[Unscented Kalman Filter]].

For state spaces which do not conform whatsoever to a linear model, a [[Particle Filter]] can be used.
