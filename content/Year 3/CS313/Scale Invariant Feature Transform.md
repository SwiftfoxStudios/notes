> SIFT is a [[Feature (& Corner) Detection|feature detection algorithm]], which is invariant to scale, which is an issue with the [[Harris Corner Detector]].

It consists of the following steps:
- Find extrema of features in the scale space
- Plot key points
- Assign an orientation to each key point
- Describe key points
