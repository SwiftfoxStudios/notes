> State Estimation is the process of a [[robot]] generating a belief about its position or state in a given environment, from [[Sensing|sensors]] (measurement data, $z_t$) and actions (control data, $u_t$) at a given time, $t$.

We form a belief of a robot's state given a probability function. This may be:
- [[Bayes Filter|Discrete]]
- [[Gaussian Filter|Gaussian]]
