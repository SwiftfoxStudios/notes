> A robot uses sensors to perceive the environment and itself.

We utilise sensors to increase flexibility, save time and increase safety.
Sensing relies on converting physical or chemical quantities into electric signals and interpreting the data - this is the *perception*.

Robots need to gain understanding from both raw data and context.

## Process
The sensing process is split up into five sections:
- **Transduction** (converting a physical quantity into an electrical signal)
- **Conditioning** (linearisation and amplification)
- **Interface** (from signal to code)
- **Data Reduction** (sensor fusion to generate a model)
- **Perception** (inference about the environment)

## Classification of Sensors
### Types
A sensor that perceives the external environment is **[[Exteroceptive Sensors|exteroceptive]]**.
A sensor that gathers internal data about the robot is **[[Proprioceptive Sensors|proprioceptive]]**.

Likewise, some sensors can influence the environment when measuring (Such as LiDAR, which relies on transmitting lasers). These are **active sensors**.

**Passive sensors** simply *'listen'* to the environment.

### Characteristics
> Sensors have several characteristics that influence their performance.

- Bandwidth (how frequently can the sensor measure?)
- [[Sensor Accuracy|Accuracy]] (how correct is the sensor?)
- Precision (how are results affected in repeated scenarios under unchanged conditions?)
- Resolution (what is the minimum range between two distinct detectable values?)
- Linearity (is the input a linear function when plotted against the output?)
- Sensitivity (how sensitive is it to the property and how insensitive is it to other properties?)
