> Neural Computing techniques use [[Machine Learning]] methods in order to train a brain-like Neural Network. It models a brain with a system of [[Neuron|neurons]].

## Training
> When training a network, a dataset is split into training data and test data. As such, we can train the model and test its accuracy independently.
