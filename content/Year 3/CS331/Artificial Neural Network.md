> ANN's model a network of neurons in a similar method to the biological neural network (*brain*). We can mimic the brain's behaviour to train a model.

There are two main categories of ANN:
- [[Feedforward Neural Network]]
- [[Recurrent Neural Network]]
## Structure
An ANN consists of an input layer, output layer and (optionally) a number of hidden layers.

## History
The first ANN was conjured in 1943 as the [[MP Neuron]].
Development in the field continued to advance until the 80s (*AI Winter*), where research was published detailing the issues of the current technology being unable to correctly classify linearly inseparable data. This was solved with the [[Year 3/CS345/Multilayer Perceptron]].
