> **LSTM**s are a type of [[Recurrent Neural Network]].

Essentially, we can control temporal dependency within an RNN (which previous timesteps influence the current one) by using [[Gated Memory Cells]].

The gates used are the Input Gate, Forget Gate and Output Gate (*see [[Gated Memory Cells]]*).
