> **Hebbian Theory**, or the **Hebbian Learning Rule** is a ruleset used to explain how a network learns through [[Associative Learning]].

It states:
- Neurons that **fire** together **wire** together.
- Neurons that fire **out of sync** fail to **link**.

The motivation is that simultaneous activation of neurons leads to an increase in the strength between those neurons.
