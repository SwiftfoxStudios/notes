> CNNs are a type of [[Feedforward Neural Network]]. They allow for the analysis and learning on data of higher dimensions, typically in image processing.

Several *convolutional* layers are used alongside typical perceptron layers. These perform a [[Convolution]] on the input data. This is typically useful for high pass filtering, and by extension, edge detection for feature extraction.

Typically, CNNs also have *pooling* layers. These utilise subsampling to reduce the number of dimensions of the data.
