> **PLA** is a method of [[Dimensionality Reduction Methods|dimensionality reduction]] which aims to solve the trend-loss problem with zero-order approximation functions, such as [[Piecewise Aggregate Approximation]].

It is a first-order (linear) approximation, created by determining the gradient of a line of best fit through the points within a segment.

This is found via the least squares method. *This is left out*.
