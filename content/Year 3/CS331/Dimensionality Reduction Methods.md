> Datasets with high dimensions can suffer from the *curse of dimensionality*, often leading to overfitting and worse predictions.

Here, we introduce three main methods of reducing the dimension of a dataset, specifically when concerned with *time-series data*.

- [[Piecewise Aggregate Approximation]]
- [[Piecewise Linear Approximation]]
- [[Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation]]
