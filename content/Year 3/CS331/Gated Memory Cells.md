> Gates are used in [[Long Short-Term Memory]] [[Recurrent Neural Network|RNNs]].

They allow for the ability to control temporal dependency between the memory of nodes.
They are binary (for simplicity).
## Input Gate
The IG controls whether data is able to enter memory.

## Output Gate
The OG controls if data can leave memory.

## Forget Gate
The FG controls if all previous data in memory can be erased.
