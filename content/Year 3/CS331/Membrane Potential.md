> The [[Neuron|axon]] transmits signals via *nerve impulses*. Specifically, via a changing membrane potentials.

When a [[Neuron|neuron]] is not firing, the voltage difference across the cell membrane of the axon is *at rest*. The potential at this stage is ~**-70mV**.

This potential is negative due to more cations leaving the cell than entering.

## Action Potential
> When a neuron wishes to transmit a signal via its axon, an action potential occurs. A stimulus causes the potential to increase above a threshold (typically **-55mV**).

Only stimuli causing an increase above the threshold will evoke a response. This is called the *all or none* principle.

In practice, the phases of an action potential are:
- The **stimulus** causes sodium<sup>+</sup> ions to rush inside the cell.
- This causes **depolarisation**.
- The potassium<sup>+</sup> channels open, causing K<sup>+</sup> ions to leave the cell.
- This causes **repolarisation**.
- The refractory period stabilises the density of ions.
