For denser graphs, the *Adjacency Matrix* is useful for representing relationships whilst minimising the computational intensity required to access, store and search within the records.

However, for sparser graphs, better representations are required:
- Adjacency List
- [[Yale Format]]
- [[Coordinate List]]
