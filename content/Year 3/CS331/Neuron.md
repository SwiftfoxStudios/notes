> The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system.

Neurons have four basic elements:
- **Dendrites** receive signals from other neurons.
- The **soma** processes the information.
- The **axon** transmits information through [[Membrane Potential|action potentials]].
- **[[Synapse|Synapses]]** are the points of connections between neurons.

Neurons divide the work required, with each neuron performing a certain role or responding to a specific stimulus.

## Sensory Neurons
> Sensory neurons are located in *receptors*. They inform the brain of external stimuli, such as vision and hearing.

## Motor Neurons
> Motor neurons allow the brain to control movement through *effectors*. These are located in the motor cortex and CNS.
## Relay Neurons
> Relay neurons act as relays between receptors and effectors.
