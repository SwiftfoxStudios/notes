> ML is the process of using statistical methods to give computers the ability to learn.

A subset of ML is [[Neural Computing]].

ML can, however, exist without [[Neural Computing]], such as with [[Support Vector Machines]].

There are three main 'learning' types:
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]
