> **APCA** is a method of [[Dimensionality Reduction Methods|dimensionality reduction]] which aims to solve the lack of provision for variable length segments in time series data in other reduction methods, such as with [[Piecewise Aggregate Approximation]].

In simple terms, we utilise the *Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform* to determine coefficient variance within the series data, in order to accurately size the segments to minimise the error due to overfitting.
