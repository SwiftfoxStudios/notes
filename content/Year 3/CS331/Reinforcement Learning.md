> Reinforcement Learning relies on purely interaction between the agent and its environment. As such, *there is no need for predefined data*.

We define a reward function which is dependent on an agent's actions. The agent's objective is to maximise this reward function. This creates a feedback loop.

## Pavlovian Conditioning
> Pavlovian conditioning is the process of having two stimuli (one neutral and one physiological), such that when paired, the neutral stimulus evokes an identical response to the physiological stimulus. It is a type of [[Associative Learning]].

This is the foundation of reinforcement learning.
