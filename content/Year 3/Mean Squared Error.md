> The MSE is an estimator of the difference between an observed principle and an estimation. It is often used as a [[Loss Function|cost function]].

It is defined as the mean of the squares of the differences, summed.
## Example
Consider the set of data:
$$2,4,5,3$$
with observed quantities:
$$3,4,5,2$$
The error values are then:
$$1,0,0,-1$$
The squared values are then:
$$1,0,0,1 \to \sum=2$$
As such, the MSE is then $\frac{2}{4}=0.5$.
