> Covariance is a measure of the variability of two random variables.

Specifically, a positive covariance indicates a general positive correlation for the same values across both variables (and vice versa).

Normalising the covariance gives the [[Pearson Correlation Coefficient]]. This is:
$$r(X,Y) = \frac{covar(X,Y)}{\sigma(X)\cdot\sigma(Y)}$$
