> Welcome to my third year notes vault!

Everything here is constantly being updated!
If something is incorrect, [email me](mailto:antonio.brito@warwick.ac.uk)!

Not all pages are complete, or contain all the required information, but are generally tailored to content you'd be expected to know in the exam.

The modules shown here are:
# [[Year-3/CS313|CS313 (Mobile Robotics)]]
# CS331 (Neural Computing)
# CS345 (Sensor Networks)
# CS352 (Project Management)
# CS355 (Digital Forensics)

## How to use?
These notes are **not** in chronological or lecture order - they are more similar to a *mind map* or *wiki* - that is, each concept large enough to have a distinct page, has a distinct page.

Similar concepts are connected through hyperlinks when they first appear on a page. This way, you are always able to click on a concept you don't know much about and all information is easier to digest (because the pages are shorter!)

Concepts that are used in multiple modules *generally* aren't in the module folders - looking at you, [[Fourier Transform]]!
